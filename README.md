Linear Regression Assignment: Parcel Delivery Time Estimation
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply linear regression techniques to a real-world business scenario. regression analysis has been done to identify key relationships between variables, make data-driven predictions and extract actionable business insights. An understanding of how to interpret regression outputs , assess model performance and effectively communicate findings to support strategic decision-making has been developed.
Analysis Approach
Data Preparation
1. Data types are fixed appropriately to match data requirements.
2. Features are engineered effectively toadd value to the analysis
Train Test Split
Data is split correctly into training and test sets maintaining a ratio of 80:20
Exploratory Data Analysis
1.	The target variable’s distribution and relationships are analysed using relevant plots and clear explanations.
2.	Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) are calculated and correctly interpreted for all relevant variables.
3.	Feature distributions are visualised using appropriate plots, with clear insights provided on trends and anomalies.
4.	Outliers are identified accurately and handled appropriately, ensuring no significant loss of information.
Model Building
1.	Target and feature variables are defined correctly.
2.	A baseline Linear Regression model is initialised and trained correctly.
3.	Feature elimination is performed effectively using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). A suitable balance between the number of features and resulting performance is maintained.
4.	The selected features from RFE are identified and used for the final model.
5.	Predictions on test data are generated and evaluated.
6.	Model evaluation is conducted using appropriate performance metrics.
Results and Inference
1.	Residual analysis is implemented correctly, and inferences are drawn accurately.
2.	Error analysis is performed appropriately, clearly explaining the model’s performance.
