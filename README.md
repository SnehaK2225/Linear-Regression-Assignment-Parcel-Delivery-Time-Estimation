# Linear-Regression-Assignment-Parcel-Delivery-Time-Estimation
📦 Parcel Delivery Time Estimation: Linear Regression Assignment
🎯 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply Linear Regression techniques to a real-world business problem—estimating parcel delivery time.
Through this analysis, we aim to:

Identify key relationships between variables

Make data-driven predictions

Extract actionable business insights

Interpret regression outputs

Assess model performance

Communicate findings effectively to support strategic decision-making

🧠 Analysis Approach
1️⃣ Data Preparation
Data types were corrected to match modeling requirements.

Meaningful feature engineering was performed to enrich the dataset.

2️⃣ Train-Test Split
The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📊 The distribution of the target variable was visualized and interpreted.

📈 Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for key features.

📌 Feature distributions were analyzed to uncover trends and detect anomalies.

⚠️ Outliers were accurately identified and handled without compromising critical information.

4️⃣ Model Building
✅ Target and predictor variables were clearly defined.

📦 A baseline Linear Regression model was initialized and trained.

🔁 Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was applied for feature selection, striking a balance between simplicity and performance.

⭐ Selected features from RFE were used to train the final model.

📤 Predictions were made on the test dataset.

📏 Model performance was evaluated using appropriate regression metrics.

5️⃣ Results and Inference
📉 Residual analysis was performed to validate model assumptions and quality of fit.

❌ Error analysis provided insights into prediction accuracy and model limitations.

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of linear regression for solving a delivery-related business problem. It showcases a complete pipeline from data preparation and exploration to model evaluation and interpretation—enabling data-driven strategic decisions.
